Group Project 3

CHICAGO CRIME ANALYSIS

Our group has decided to use a Kaggle.com dataset of Chicago Crime Statistics to analyze twenty years of narcotics related crimes. Specifically we will focus on the variety of drugs used over the period from 2000-2019 and their distribution across the city, while also looking for trends that correlate to drug-related deaths/homicides. The purpose of this analysis is to try and reveal the narcotics related crime patterns to understand how to better minimize both use and death by people in Chicago.

Visualizations:

-Pie Graph for 20 year total of narcotics crimes

-Line graphs of points/year per narcotic crime to observe trends

-Map of narcotic distribution (beat, district, location, etc) around Chicago color coded bubbles sizes; per narcotic type

-Map of narcotic related deaths color coded

-What areas are improving or getting worse, narcotic specific?

-What year is the worst for narcotic type, deaths?

EXPLORATION & CLEANUP

*need to know all categories of "definition" for "primary type" of crime

INSPECT DATA AND GENERATE CLEAN DATA SET

-REQUIREMENTS-

1. Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).

2. Your project should fall into one of the following three tracks:

A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly

A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data

A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)

3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.

4. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.

5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).

6. Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.

Create internal milestones to ensure that your group is on track. Set due dates for these milestones so that you have a timeline for completing the project. Some of these milestones might include:

Project ideation

Data fetching/API integration

Data analysis

Testing

Creating documentation

Creating the presentation
