CHICAGO CRIME ANALYSIS

Our group has decided to use a Kaggle.com dataset of Chicago Crime Statistics to analyze twenty years of narcotics related crimes. Specifically we will focus on the variety of drugs used over the period from 2000-2019 and their distribution across the city, while also looking for trends that correlate to drug-related deaths/homicides. The purpose of this analysis is to try and reveal the narcotics related crime patterns to understand how to better minimize both use and death by people in Chicago.

Visualizations:

-Pie Graph for 20 year total of narcotics crimes

-Line graphs of points/year per narcotic crime to observe trends

-Map of narcotic distribution (beat, district, location, etc) around Chicago color coded bubbles sizes; per narcotic type

-Map of narcotic related deaths color coded

-What areas are improving or getting worse, narcotic specific?

-What year is the worst for narcotic type, deaths?
