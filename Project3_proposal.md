--Project Proposal: Interactive Web Page for Chicago Crime Narcotics Data Analysis--


    --Introduction:
        Chicago has had a long-standing problem with crime, particularly with regards to narcotics.
        The Chicago Police Department has been collecting crime data for years, and the information
        they have gathered can be used to gain valuable insights into the nature of crime in the 
        city. In this project, we aim to create an interactive web page using Javascript and HTML 
        to visualize the Chicago crime narcotics data.

    
    --Objectives:
        The objectives of this project are as follows:
        1. To analyze the crime data and identify trends in the occurrence of narcotics-related crimes in Chicago over the past five years.
        2. To create an interactive web page that allows users to explore the data and gain insights into the nature of the problem.
        3. To provide visualizations of the data that are clear and easy to understand.
   
    --Methods:
        The following methods will be used to achieve the objectives of the project:
        Data Collection: The data will be collected from different csv files that were found from Kaggle. The data will be examined
        and stored in a suitable format for analysis.
        Data Analysis: The data will be analyzed to identify trends and patterns in the occurrence of narcotics-related crimes in Chicago over the past five years.
        Web Page Design: The web page will be designed using HTML and Javascript. The page will allow users to interact with the data and explore different aspects of the problem.
        Data Visualization: The data will be visualized using charts and graphs that are clear and easy to understand.
   
   
    --Requirements:
        Include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
        Our project will fall into the track of an interactive dashbopard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
        Include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
        Project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records
        Project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
        Final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
        
        
    --Deliverables:
        The following deliverables will be provided as part of the project:
        Cleaned and processed Chicago crime narcotics data from 2016 to 2020.
        An interactive web page that allows users to explore the data and gain insights into the nature of the problem.
        Visualizations of the data that are clear and easy to understand.
        Documentation on how to use the web page and understand the data.
    
    
    --Timeline:
        The project will be completed within a period of 2 weeks. The following is the proposed timeline:
        Data collection and cleaning 
        Data analysis and visualization
        Web page design and development
        Testing and debugging 
        Documentation and final touches 
        
    --Conclusion:
        This project aims to provide valuable insights into the nature of narcotics-related crimes in Chicago over the past five years. The interactive web page will allow users to explore the data and gain insights into different aspects of the problem. The visualizations of the data will be clear and easy to understand, making it accessible to a wide range of users. Overall, this project will contribute to a better understanding of the problem of narcotics-related crimes in Chicago and could potentially inform policy decisions aimed at reducing crime rates in the city.
